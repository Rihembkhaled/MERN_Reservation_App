"# MERN_Reservation_App" 
School Music Instrument Reservation System
This project is a School Music Instrument Reservation System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows school music students to reserve musical instruments, with an administrative panel for managing instruments and users.

Features
Authentication: Students can log in without registration since only the admin can add them.
Student Dashboard: Students can view available instruments, reserve them, and log out.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can add students, add, delete, and edit instruments, and access an admin panel for viewing total counts.
Real-time Updates: Changes made by the admin are instantly reflected across the application.
